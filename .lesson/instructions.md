# Instructions

This project provides a simple command line script to ask the user questions
from the file. The question file uses the pre-defined structure. After all
answers are gathered, the total score is displayed to the user and the script
execution is completed.

## Objective

Your task is to implement a script to run a command line based quiz.
The users will enter their names and answer questions from the file
one-by-one. At the end of the quiz the score should be displayed to
the user, and a record should be created inside the *scores.txt* file.
